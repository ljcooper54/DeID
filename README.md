This is a Windows Desktop app that allows you to securely de-identify files.
It converts names, email addresses, locations, product names, code names, etc. to unique identifiers.
It's designed to be used when sending confidential material to an LLM: You can obscure multiple files, 
pass it to the LLM for analsis / summary, and then "restore" the output of the LLM to reintroduce your confidential words.

It supports basic file types, and converts them to raw text, for easy input to the LLM.
It supports multiple (passworded) users, multiple projects dictionaries per user, and the introduction of 
User Defined lists of keywords to be automatically translated (e.g. initials like -dde- or code words like family)
